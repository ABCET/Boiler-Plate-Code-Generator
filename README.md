# Boiler-Plate-Code-Generator

Boilerplate Code Generator is a user-friendly tool designed to assist developers and programmers in quickly generating code snippets for various programming tasks. It aims to streamline the coding process and reduce manual effort by offering a simple interface where users can select their preferred development stack, programming language, and other components to generate the desired code.

### Key Features:
1.Stack Selection: Users can choose from a range of predefined development stacks, such as Frontend Development, Backend Development, Mobile App Development, AI/ML, Database, and Data Visualization. Each stack corresponds to a set of related technologies and tools commonly used for specific types of projects.

2.Language/Library Selection: Within each stack, users can further select their preferred programming language or library. The available options are tailored to the chosen stack, ensuring that only relevant choices are presented to the user.

3.Frontend Component Generation: For Frontend Development, users can select specific components they wish to generate code for, such as buttons, forms, carousels, and navigation bars. This feature allows developers to create boilerplate code for common UI elements, saving time during web development.

4.AI/ML Algorithm Selection: Within the AI/ML stack, users can choose from a variety of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. This feature facilitates the rapid generation of machine learning code for various use cases.

5.Code Output and Copy: Once the user has made their selections, the application generates the corresponding code snippet, tailored to their chosen options. The generated code is displayed in a user-friendly format within a scrollable output box. A "Copy" button is provided to allow users to easily copy the generated code to their clipboard and paste it into their projects.

## How it Works ?

1.Select desired development stack (e.g., Frontend, Backend, AI/ML) and programming language/library from dropdown menus.

2.Further customize their code by selecting specific components or algorithms, and upon clicking the "Generate Code" button, a code snippet is displayed in the output box, ready to be copied to the clipboard with a single click.

## Libraries used

1.Flask==2.1.1

2.Flask-Cors==3.0.10

3.openai==0.27.8

## How to configure

1.Make sure you have the latest versions of Node.js, npm, and Python installed on your machine.

2.Clone the repository containing the project files or download the files to your local machine.

``````
git clone https://github.com/ABCET/Boiler-Plate-Code-Generator
``````

3.In the Frontend directory of the project, run the following command to install all the required packages for the React frontend.

``````
npm install
``````

4.In the Backend directory of the project, run the following command to install all the required packages for the Flask backend.

``````
pip install -r requirements.txt
``````

## How to Run

1.Start the React development server by running the following command in the Frontend directory of the project. This will start the frontend on localhost.

``````
npm start
``````

2.Start the Flask backend by running the following command in the Backend directory. This will start the backend on localhost. 

``````
python run.py
``````

3.Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can access notifier app by navigating to http://localhost:5000/ in your browser.
